<h1>Frequency Counter in Java</h1>

  <p>This Java program counts the frequencies of elements in an array and displays the results.</p>

   <h2>Description</h2>

   <p>The program takes an array of integers and calculates the frequency of each element in the array. It then prints the element and its corresponding frequency.</p>

   <h2>Example</h2>

   <p>Given the array: [10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20, 5, 5, 20]</p>

   <p>The output will be:</p>

  <pre>
    10 appeared 3 times.
    20 appeared 4 times.
    5 appeared 2 times.
    </pre>

   <h2>Usage</h2>

   <ol>
        <li>Update the <code>array</code> variable in the <code>main</code> method of the <code>Main</code> class with your desired array of integers.</li>
        <li>Compile and run the program using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Java.</li>
    </ol>

   <h2>Implementation Details</h2>

   <p>The program sorts the array in ascending order to group identical elements together. It then counts the frequencies by iterating over the sorted array and incrementing a corresponding counter for each occurrence of an element. The results are printed to the console.</p>
